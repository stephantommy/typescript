tsc command:
- tsc app.ts 			  // compile app.ts into app.js
- tsc app.ts -w			// auto compile app.ts into app.js everytime app.ts is changed
- tsc init			    // initialize the current wordir as typescript project
- tsc 				      // compile all ts file inside the typescript project directory (only applicable after tsc --init)
- tsc -w 				    // auto compile all ts file inside the typescript project directory (only applicable after tsc --init) everytime ts file is changed


tsconfig.json options:
- "exclude" : to exclude some ts file from compiling with 'tsc' or 'tsc -w' command. 
  By default WITHOUT this 'exclude' option being defined, the node_modules is already excluded from tsc compile, but if you defined this 'exclude' options, you have to add the node_modules manually.
  Ex:
    "exclude":[
        "node_modules",
        "somefile.dev.ts",
        "**/*.dev.ts",      // can also use wild card
    ]

- "include" : the opposite of exclude.
  By default WITHOUT this 'include' option being defined, EVERYTHING is included, but if you defined this 'include' options, you have to add the ts files manually. 
  Ex:
    "include":[
        "app.ts",
        "lib.ts",
    ]

- "files" : same with include, but you cant specify folders with 'files' option

- "compilerOptions":
  "target"          : string,       Specify ECMAScript target version.
  "lib"             : [],           Specify library files to be included in the compilation. By defualt, the library included follows the specified target compilation.
  "allowJs"         : booelan,      Allow javascript files to be compiled.
  "checkJs"         : booelan,      Report errors in .js files.
  "sourceMap"       : boolean,      Generates corresponding '.map' file. To show ts files in the chrome dev tools Sources Tab, you need this map file.
  "outDir"          : string,       Redirect output structure to the directory. The folder structure will the origin location of each input file in the --rootDir.
  "rootDir"         : string,       Specify the root directory of input files. Use to control the output directory structure with --outDir. By default, the rootDir is src folder ONLY IF all the input file is in the src folder, otherwise the default will be on where the tsc init command excecuted.
  "removeComments"  : boolean,      Do not emit comments to output.
  "noEmit"          : boolean,      Do not emit outputs.
